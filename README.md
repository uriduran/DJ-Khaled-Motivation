# DJ KHALED MOTIVATION
I currently have a good understanding of shell scripting in Linux/Mac but I have
never actually tried learning BASH for Windows. I am making this script to try
and learn to script. Currently it is very basic. But I hope to make it more
complex and add more fun stuff in the future.

## How It Works ##
Currently the script generates a random number between 1-40 and stores it as a
variable. The variable is then checked through 40 IF statements (If you know a more
simple or more efficient way of doing this please let me know) and it echos
whichever IF statement the random number matches.

Then the user is asked if they want more quotes. y or n as inputs. If yes the
script calls itself and exits the current window. If no then the window simply
closes.

## How To Run ##
Just download this folder with the download button. Put the Motivation.cmd file
in a convenient place where you can access DJ Khaled quotes the easiest and double
click to run.

Please submit any bugs if found.

## Future ##
I don't expect anyone to watch/star this project cus its dumb but if you do
just pull every so often to update the script as I'll be adding more stuff
as I go through tutorials.

Will accept any push requests as long as you explain to me what stuff does so I
can learn.
